before start chapter one, we're going to install django and selenium

# pip install django
# pip install selenium

now generate the requirements

after creating a new file called functional_tests.py, we are going to create a django project


chapter 2

functional tests --> user's point of view, it is end-to-end tests

setUp and tearDown run just before and after each test

Useful TDD Concepts
User Story
A description of how the application will work from the point of view of the user.
Used to structure a functional test.
Expected failure
When a test fails in the way that we expected it to



chapter 3

now we are going to create a django app

functional vs unit tests

functional => test from the outside, from the point of view of the user
unit => from the point of view of the developer

steps for tdd
1 - write functional test of functionality (user point of view), at first it should fail
2 - now write one or more unit tests to define how we want our code to behave
3 - once unit test fails, write the smallest amount of application code, to unit get unit test to pass.
(iterate between topic 2 and 3)
4 - now rerun functional test
